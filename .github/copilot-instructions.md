This project is a React + Vite site for the Gloucester Zakat Fund. Use a green and cream color scheme, modern clean UI, and include pages for Home, About, Trustees, What is Zakat, FAQ, Community, Apply, Calculate Zakat, Contact, and Latest News. All content and templates should be tailored for Gloucester, not London.
