        <h2>Meet the Trustees</h2>
        <p>To ensure good effective governance, provide leadership and vision it is essential for a charity to have trustees who have particular qualities and specialised skills. This allows the charity to fulfil its purpose in a manner that instils confidence in the hearts and minds of its supporters and beneficiaries.</p>
        <p>The Gloucester Zakat Fund is overseen by five trustees who are well-known reputable members of Gloucester's Muslim community. All the trustees have extensive experience in leadership roles which, combined with the experience gained from managing other successful local charities, provide the Gloucester Zakat Fund vision and strategic direction.</p>
