                    "question": "What is Zakat?",
                    "answer": "Zakat is an obligatory form of charity for eligible Muslims, usually calculated as 2.5% of one's surplus wealth. It purifies wealth and supports those in financial difficulty. Zakat is one of the five pillars of Islam."

                    "question": "What is the purpose of the Gloucester Zakat Fund?",
                    "answer": "Our charity collects and distributes Zakat locally to eligible Muslims in Gloucestershire, with a particular focus on Gloucester, helping those in hardship while adhering to Islamic principles."
                },
                {
                    "question": "Is the fund managed by qualified individuals?",
                    "answer": "Yes, the fund is overseen by a trusted team including community leaders and advisors with knowledge of Islamic finance and local welfare needs. All applications are reviewed with confidentiality, care, and accountability."

                    "question": "Can I give my Zakat to a local cause?",
                    "answer": "Absolutely. Islam encourages giving Zakat to eligible individuals within your own locality (ahl al-balad), and our fund ensures it stays within the local community."

                {
                    "question": "How do you assess if someone is eligible to receive Zakat?",
                    "answer": "We assess based on Islamic criteria, including assets, debts, income, and liabilities. The applicant must fall below the nisāb threshold and fit within one of the eight eligible categories mentioned in the Qur'ān (9:60)."
                },
                {
                    "question": "Do you only accept Zakat, or can I give Sadaqa too?",
                    "answer": "We accept both Zakat and Sadaqa. While Zakat has strict guidelines, Sadaqa allows more flexibility to support a broader range of needs including non-Muslims, community projects, and urgent hardship."
                },
                {
                    "question": "Can I choose where my Zakat goes?",
                    "answer": "Zakat donations are pooled to ensure fair distribution based on need and eligibility. While we can't guarantee donor-directed allocations, you're welcome to contact us if you have a preference for supporting specific causes (e.g., refugees, housing support)."

                {
                    "question": "What is the current niṣāb threshold?",
                    "answer": "The niṣāb is the minimum wealth a Muslim must have before Zakat becomes obligatory. It is based on the value of: 87.48g of gold or 612.36g of silver. We recommend using the silver value to ensure more people benefit, but individuals may follow their preferred scholarly opinion. Please check updated prices before calculating your Zakat."
